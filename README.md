# Division by Zero in PHP

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in PHP: division by zero.  The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.

The error is subtle because it's not always immediately apparent where a zero value might appear unexpectedly.  Robust error handling is key to preventing crashes and ensuring application stability.
